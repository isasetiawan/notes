Inspired by Fastapi implementation on defining endpoint function, where the way to defining endpoint can be done without parsing params i.e header, body request etc verbosely.

## Plan
### Check how function can be reflected in Go
### List Down Params can be gather from fiber context

### Define tags based on params in fiber context
