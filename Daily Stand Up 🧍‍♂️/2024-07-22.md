		1. group by localized period
	4. If temporary allocation
		1. validate branch id existence
		2. create location changes on shift
	5. UX log
	6. Push notification on background process

### Need Help

Heads up API related to C.14, C.17 and C.18 (not in this sprint)
Due to partial release and re-prioritization of PK080 endpoint **ClientBulkUpdateBranchShift** required to be migrated to version 2 path i.e `v2/branch-shifts/bulk` in order to:
1. Avoid blocking current functionality on partial release
2. Avoid whole body request reconstruction. Since, the existing endpoint use whole body request as list `[]` instead of object `{}`
3. Since the endpoint hold of creation, update and deletion of shift assignments. Those functionality could be moved gradually
