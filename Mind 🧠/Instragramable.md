## Living Context

For me, In the context if home living, Instagramable is contradict with the nature of living. 
Instagramable means everything is staged to be visually appealing, not fully capture the authenticity of everyday life. Meanwhile, living is about being natural. Everything isn't must in order, sometimes you put things randomly based on your natural behavior.

I understand that Instagram is source of pride by nature. People tend to show of what they have. but making a house is Instagramable as a main goals is not a good idea. Ultimately, home is about comfort, functionality, and personal expression, whether or not it fits an Instagram mold.

Please take note that not fully agree with a messy house. As i mention a home is about personal expression too. Hence, as a person that trying to be well-organized, I do not agree with concept of messy house. I prefer finding a balance between level of messiness or randomness and aesthetic. 

## Habit as Identity

Also, I found that instragramable contradict with my life value. To not be triggered by what people have, As stoicism says that happiness is about maintaining our own expectations. Also, in Instagram people tend to show an achievement only, not what they have been through to achieve that.

After i read Atomic Habit book by James Clear. a Habit can construct Identity and vice versa. So, i rather see a high inspiring people or popular people by what habit they have, what routines that make them to be that inspiring. 

When i saw a visually appealing instagram post, I ask my self "Is it what they do every day, or Is it just a prefect capture moment". So, sometimes i don't judge people by what they post. I encouraging my self that there is something that i can't sense.
