When i sense my surrounding with my limited sensing. I occasionally thinking about people age. I wonder about what people have been through with their time. Then, i ask anLLM about generation classification e.g baby boomer, x-generation etc. I think this classification is generalisation about what people faced through time to make it easy

>1. **Independence Generation (born around the 1920s-1940s):** This generation lived through Indonesia's struggle for independence from Dutch colonial rule. They experienced the fight for freedom, the aftermath of World War II, and the birth of a new nation amidst political upheavals.
>2. **Baby Boomers in Indonesia (born approximately 1940s-1960s):** These individuals witnessed the early years of Indonesia's independence and the establishment of the nation. They experienced economic development, political changes, and cultural shifts as Indonesia emerged as an independent state.
>3. **Generation X in Indonesia (born around 1960s-1980s):** This generation grew up during a time of political stability under the New Order government. They saw economic growth but also faced challenges related to political restrictions and limited access to information compared to later generations.
>4. **Millennials in Indonesia (born approximately 1980s-early 2000s):** Millennials in Indonesia witnessed the transition from the New Order regime to a more democratic era. They experienced rapid globalization, technological advancements, and greater access to information through the internet. They faced economic changes, including job market shifts and the impact of global economic fluctuations.
>5. **Generation Z in Indonesia (born around the mid-1990s to early 2010s):** This generation has grown up in a fully digital age in Indonesia. They are tech-savvy, heavily reliant on social media, and have access to a wealth of information. They face challenges such as adapting to a fast-paced world, dealing with the pressures of social media, and navigating an increasingly competitive job market.

From that answer, i notice that my generation witnessing a rapid technological improvement. I witness how social media evolve. From friendster to TikTok. I witness how technology changes people life, like the existence of ride hailing app, start-ups, E-commerce etc.

I am being grateful to not being so clueless as baby boomer generation or being absorbed by technology as Gen-Z.
